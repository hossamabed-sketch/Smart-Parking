SLOT 1:
-------
Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04:
  - TRIG → GPIO 14
  - ECHO → GPIO 27
  - VCC  → 5V
  - GND  → GND

LEDs:
  - RED LED   → GPIO 32 (with 220Ω resistor)
  - GREEN LED → GPIO 33 (with 220Ω resistor)

SLOT 2:
-------
Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04:
  - TRIG → GPIO 25
  - ECHO → GPIO 26
  - VCC  → 5V
  - GND  → GND

LEDs:
  - RED LED   → GPIO 18 (with 220Ω resistor)
  - GREEN LED → GPIO 19 (with 220Ω resistor)

SLOT 3:
-------
Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04:
  - TRIG → GPIO 4
  - ECHO → GPIO 5
  - VCC  → 5V
  - GND  → GND

LEDs:
  - RED LED   → GPIO 21 (with 220Ω resistor)
